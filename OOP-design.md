## Class 3

This class will be the zombie cat. Similarly it will have inheritance from the creature class. GridPoint information is encapsulated in the city class so it will be utilizing that as well.

## Class 4
This class will be the new creature that is not yet named. It will inherit from the creature class. The encapsulation will be in the city class in which we don't have to expose information in this class since we already have it in the parent class
